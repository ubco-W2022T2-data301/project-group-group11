# A Deeper Look into Apple's Stock Value

## Introduction

Our project focuses on Apple's Stock Value, specifically, what factors contribute to the value of Apples’ stock and how Apple's stock value compares to other companies in the same industry. To investigate these focuses we chose to look at how iPhones impacted Apple's stock value as the factor and how Apple's stock values compare to Microsoft’s stock value as the comparison. The main dataset that we are using to conduct this exploratory data analysis is a dataset that contains Apple's opening, closing, high, low, adjusted closing stock values, and Apple's stock volume for the entire time Apple has been publicly traded company. Further, for analysis number 1, a dataset was created that contained every iPhone and the date it was released to further study how the release of iPhones impacted Apple's stock value. For analysis number 2 a dataset the contained the same information as the main Apple dataset was used to analyze how Apple’s stock value compared to Microsoft’s stock value.
