Our data set includes the opening, closing, adjusted closing, high, and low market value of Apple for every day from January 3, 2010 to December 29, 2022. The data set also includes the volume of Apple’s stock for every day during the same time period. This dataset was found on Kaggle where it was retrieved from Yahoo Finance’s historical data of stock prices; therefore, we can conclude that this data is accurate and up to date.

In addition, the data can be used to understand the public’s opinion of Apple as a company over the last decade by analyzing the slopes of the data.
